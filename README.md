# ThreadArtDB
This project is a graphical interface designed to manage a database of ThreadArt images, regardless the algorithm used.

It doesn't incorporate by default any thread art generation algorithm.


# Disclaimer
This project is also a way for me to experiment with Python features and does not claim to be a fully functional tool at the moment.
